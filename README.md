# Getting Started with Create React App

This TicTacToe game was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

When you clone the project:
<br/>
:zap: <b>npm install</b> /--/ <b>yarn</b>  for installing libraries and dependencies.
<br/>
:rocket: <b>npm start</b> /--/ <b>yarn start</b>  for launch

In this game you can:
1. Play with classic TicTacToe (if you want to play with your friend, but just don't have pen/paper - just use my game) :raised_hands:
2. All your steps are saved in LocalStorage! it is really usefull if your refresh the page. :floppy_disk:
3. If you desagree with your current situation you can go back to the past and check your step and continue from this step! Awesome! :calendar:
